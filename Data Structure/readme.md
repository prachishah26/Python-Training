### Program1- Slice list into 3 equal chunks and reverse each chunk

Input : It will take list of numbers<br>
Output : chunks with reversed value

#### Testcases:

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] | [[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4]] |
| [1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 0, 3, 6, 7] | [[7, 4, 1], [0, 9, 8], [7, 6, 3]] |

### Program2- Count the occurrence of each element from a list

Input : It will take list of numbers<br>
Output : Dictionary which will give occurance of the particular number

#### Testcases:

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| [11, 45, 8, 11, 23, 45, 23, 45, 89] | {8: 1, 11: 2, 45: 3, 23: 2, 89: 1} |
| [1, 1, 2] | {1:1, 2:1} |

### Program3- Write a Python program to get a list, sorted in increasing order by the last element in each tuple from a given list of non-empty tuples.

Input : It will take list of pairs of the numbers<br>
Output : sorted in increasing order by the last element in each tuple

#### Testcases:

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| [(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)] | [(2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 4), (2, 5)] |
| [(1, 2), (2,1)] | [(2, 1), (1, 2)] |

### Program4- Find the intersection (common) of two sets and remove those elements from the first set.
Input : It will take two sets as input<br>
Output : elements in first set which are not common in both

#### Testcases:

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| a =  {23, 42, 65, 57, 78, 83, 29},
 b =  {57, 83, 29, 67, 73, 43, 48} | {57, 83, 29}, {65, 42, 78, 23} |

### Program5- Sort given array of three random elements. 0,1 & 2. Without any sorting algorithm. Time complexity: O(n)
Input : array of random numbers<br>
Output : sorted array

#### Testcases:

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| [1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0] | [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2] |
| [0, 2, 1, 0] | [0, 0, 1, 2] |
